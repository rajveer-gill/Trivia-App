# Trivia-App

## Description
This is a small project that I created that tests your trivia knowledge! The categories of the questions vary from science, history, technology, etc. I created this app to help me understand swift more and learn the language. This was good practice for me because I want to continue to develop more swift apps and apps of my own design. It taught me how to interact between different views, models, and view-models which was a bit confusing to me before this project. It also taught me more about the differences between swift and swiftUI. Enjoy!

## Features
The app starts with its own welcome view to guide the user to the main trivia component of the app. Once the app transitions to the game view, the user can see the question progress at the very top of the screen. Right underneath it is the current question the user is on. At the bottom of the screen, there are four options for the user to choose from in order to answer the question at the top of the screen. If the user picks the correct answer, the button the user has chosen will turn green. If the wrong answer is selected, the button will turn red. The user gets one attempt per question. Once a answer is picked, another button will appear at the bottom of the screen to transition the app the the next question. This repeats until all the questions are answered. From there, the user is directed to a screen that has the results of the correct and incorrect answers the user has chosen throughout their trivia. At the bottom of the screen is a button that allows the user to restart the trivia if they choose to do so.

## How to Use
In order to use the code, it is recommended to have xcode downloaded on the intended system. From there, the user can download the zip file from github and open the zip file on their own system. The user can choose to open the file through Xcode or select "Code History.xcodeproj" located in the file.

## Technologies
The system used to create this app was a MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has an 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16 GB of memory.

## Collaborators
The project was created with the help of Code Academy.
