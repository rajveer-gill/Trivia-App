# Trivia-App

## Description
This is a small project that I created that tests your trivia knowledge! The categories of the questions vary from science, history, technology, etc. I created this app to help me understand swift more and learn the language. This was good practice for me because I want to continue to develop more swift apps and apps of my own design. It taught me how to interact between different views, models, and view-models which was a bit confusing to me before this project. It also taught me more about the differences between swift and swiftUI. Enjoy
